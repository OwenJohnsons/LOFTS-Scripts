# LOw Frequency Pulsar, FRB and Technosignature Survey 

The repository includes code for organizing and carrying out a LOFAR transient survey within the 110 - 190 MHz range using HBA (High-Band Antenna). The survey's objective is to systematically scan the entire sky at its zenith once a week, employing multiple LOFAR stations for non-interferometric beam-formed searches.
